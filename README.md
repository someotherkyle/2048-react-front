2048 Tribute

For my final project at Flatiron School, I challenged myself to recreate the 2048 game in React & Redux.
Data is persisted in a Sqlite3 Database connected through a Ruby on Rails API availabe [here](https://github.com/someotherkyle/rails-api).

Installation

Simply clone this repo, cd into it and run npm install and npm start.
If you would like to persist data, clone the accompanying Ruby on Rails repository [here](https://github.com/someotherkyle/rails-api).

Contributions and Licensing

You are welcome to utilize any of the code in this repository. I did not create the game 2048, I merely challenged myself to reproduce it.
As such, I would encourage anyone interested to create their own and use this code as a guide. Code contributions for this project defeat the purpose
of the challenge I set for myself but critiques and improvements are always welcome.
